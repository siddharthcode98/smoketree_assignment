### STEP-by-STEP PROCEDURE

- Created a database **_userAddressDetails.db_** with tables **_User_** and **_Address_**.Established a **_one-to-many-relationship_**
- Created a Express server in the **_index.js_**

I have created a **_.http_** file to make requests, **_app.http_**. We can make a request to the server. and server provides a response. I have used a VS code extenstion **_REST-CLIENT_** for this.
