# SMOKETREE ASSIGNMENT

### STEP-by-STEP PROCEDURE

- Created a database **userAddressDetails.db** with tables **User** and **Address**.Established a **one-to-many-relationship**
- Created a Express server in the **index.js**
- **User** table has 2 columns **id** and **name** and **Address** table has 3 columns **id**,**Address** and **user_id**(foreign key,which is the id of the User table)


In the **app.http**, We can make a request to the server. and server provides a response. I have used a VS code extenstion **REST-CLIENT** for this.
